Problem Statement:
Given N, find the number of ways to express N as a sum of 1, 3, 4
Example:
1.    N = 4
      Number of ways = 4 ({1,3}, {3,1}, {4}, {1,1,1,1})

2.    N = 5
      Number of ways = 4 ({4,1}, {1,4}, {1,1,3}, {1,3,1}, {3,1,1}, {1,1,1,1,1})

To make the base condition, we need to get some values already there
if
N=0 = 1
N=1 = 1
N=2 = 1 which is {1,1}
N=3 = 2 which is ({3}, {1,1,1})
